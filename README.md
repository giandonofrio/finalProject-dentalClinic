# Final project: Dental clinic for BackEnd-1 (ApiREST)
## Description
The project is a REST API of a dental clinic, where you can add, delete, update or list patients, dentists and appointments.

You can use the endpoints behind `http://localhost:8080/`

## How does it work?

Actually, much better if you just start the application and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`. There you'll find a nice API documentation thanks to Swagger.
